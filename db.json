    "title": "Elegant Mushroom Soup",
    "ingredients": "1 1/2 lb Mushrooms -- sliced 1/4\"|Thick|2 qt Chicken Broth -- College|Inn|2 Cubes|2 qt Heavy Cream -- 18%|4 tb Butter|1 ts Thyme -- ground|3 tb Cornstarch -- or less, to|Thicken|Chicken Bouillon",
    "servings": "8 Servings",
    "instructions": "* NOTE: Use 1 1/2 pounds or MORE of ripe mushrooms. The darker mushroom (older) adds a stronger flavor to the soup, that's what I usually use. I've made this with the regular white, as well as portabello mushrooms - a blend tastes fine, but the portobello tends to overpower slightly. 1. Melt butter in pot. Add sliced mushrooms, and saute gently until liquid is completely cooked out. Do not brown mushrooms. 2. Add at least 2 quarts chicken broth (reserve 1/3 cup), thyme, and bouillon. Bring to a full boil, and simmer, uncovered, until broth is reduced by 75%. Taste should be extremely strong (it will be diluted with the cream). Note: The reduction can take quite a while. 3. Mix cornstarch with reserved broth, and add to soup. Allow mixture to get very thick. 4. Gently add 2 quarts (or more) heavy cream. Blend, and bring to a gentle simmer. Taste, and adjust seasoning if needed. Thin with milk or cream if flavor is too strong, or soup is too thick. : Jocie Moravec"

    "servings": "6 Servings",
    "instructions": "Make the bouquet garni by tying the herbs up in a cheesecloth or coffee filter. Put a quart of water to boil with about 1/2 t salt (I don't like to use too much salt if I use bouillon), the bouquet garni and the bouillon. Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and add these to the soup together with the bacon and/or prosciutto ends. Bring this to a boil. Simmer 5 minutes. If scum forms on the surface, skim it off. Dice the potatoes and add to the boiling pot. Cut up everything else and add it. Add the wine. Adjust the liquid so that it covers the vegetables. After it boils again, adjust the seasoning and simmer for about an hour, or until it is done (this is quite subjective). NOTES: * Soup with a mixture of vegetables -- I had an eclectic mixture of vegetables going bad in the refrigerator, so I collected them and came up with this soup. It was very good, so I would like to share it with you all. Caveat: I rarely measure anything, so be careful of quantities. * This will serve 6 people at once, or 2 people for three days. It ages well in the refrigerator. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 10 minutes preparation, 1 hour simmering. : Precision: no need to measure."
